coffee quality analysis by power bi 
Excited to share my Capstone Project from the Data Science Bootcamp, where I explored an intriguing dataset provided by the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI). This project gave me the opportunity to dive into the world of coffee production, sensory evaluation, and defect analysis‚Äîall while applying advanced data visualization techniques with Power BI.
Key Insights:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Determinants of Coffee Quality: Identified how sensory attributes like aroma, flavor, acidity, and body significantly impact the Total Cup Points, a measure of overall coffee quality.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Regional & Processing Trends: Analyzed correlations between origin regions, processing methods, and quality scores, uncovering patterns that can enhance decision-making for growers and roasters.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Defect Analysis: Explored the occurrence of defects, both Category One and Category Two, and their measurable impact on coffee quality.
4Ô∏è‚É£ What-If Scenarios: Conducted interactive What-If analyses to simulate various conditions and assess their influence on coffee quality metrics.
Project Impact:
Through Power BI dashboards, I transformed complex datasets into intuitive visual stories, enabling stakeholders to derive actionable insights for improving coffee quality and sustainability practices.

üí° Coffee enthusiasts and data professionals: How do you think technology and data can continue to revolutionize the coffee industry? I'd love to hear your perspectives!
